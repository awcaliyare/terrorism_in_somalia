### Problem Statement

Somalia faces a persistent terrorism threat marked by various attack methods, with significant casualties stemming from both suicide and non-suicide attacks. While media attention often highlights high-profile suicide bombings, data reveal that non-suicide methods such as armed assaults and assassinations account for a substantial portion of fatalities. This discrepancy can hinder effective counter-terrorism strategies.

Additionally, the correlation between specific attack types and weapon usage remains underexplored, limiting security forces' ability to anticipate threats. The uneven regional distribution of attacks further complicates the understanding of violence, resulting in inadequate security measures.

Addressing these issues is critical for developing a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy in Somalia. This project aims to analyze the complexities of terrorism in the region to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing security and reducing casualties.


### Introduction

Somalia has grappled with terrorism amid ongoing political instability and the rise of extremist groups, leading to significant casualties and societal disruption. While media narratives often spotlight high-profile suicide bombings, a detailed analysis reveals that non-suicide attacks constitute a larger share of fatalities.

This project aims to dissect the patterns of terrorism in Somalia, focusing on attack methods, casualty trends, and weapon types. By uncovering correlations and trends, the study will illuminate the most critical threats and inform effective security strategies.

Ultimately, this analysis serves as a resource for policymakers and security forces, offering targeted recommendations to enhance counter-terrorism efforts and foster a more secure Somalia.


### Background

Somalia has faced decades of conflict and terrorism, fueled by political instability and the influence of extremist groups. This environment has led to a variety of violent incidents, including bombings, armed assaults, and assassinations, posing significant threats to public safety.

Data shows that while suicide bombings account for 27% of casualties, other methods, particularly armed assaults and bombings, contribute to 73% of fatalities. This underscores the need for a deeper understanding of terrorism dynamics in the region.

The analysis also reveals that armed assaults are primarily linked to firearms, whereas bombings predominantly involve explosives. The geographical distribution of violence highlights regions like Banaadir, Shabeellaha Hoose, and Bay as key areas of concern, while other regions experience lower casualty rates.

This project aims to analyze the nature of terrorism in Somalia, focusing on attack methods, casualty patterns, weapon types, and targeted locations, ultimately providing actionable recommendations for enhancing security measures and counter-terrorism strategies tailored to the country's unique challenges.

### Objective

This project aims to analyze terrorism in Somalia by:

1. **Identifying trends** in attack methods and associated casualties.
2. **Examining correlations** between attack types and weapon usage.
3. **Assessing regional impacts**, focusing on areas with high violence.
4. **Evaluating changes** in terrorism tactics over time.
5. **Providing actionable recommendations** for enhancing security measures.

The goal is to deliver insights that will aid policymakers and security forces in effectively combating terrorism.
