## Background

The surge of terrorism in Somalia is rooted in the collapse of the central government in the early 1990s, which created a power vacuum conducive to the rise of various militant factions. Al-Shabaab has been particularly notorious, executing numerous attacks against military, civilian, and infrastructural targets. The conflict is marked by alarming casualty rates, with peak years reporting over 3,000 fatalities. Analysis of monthly and weekly attack patterns reveals strategic planning by militants, with certain periods experiencing heightened violence.

The geographical concentration of attacks, especially in urban centers like Mogadishu, exacerbates security challenges, necessitating data-driven counterterrorism strategies. By examining historical data on terrorist incidents—including weapon types, attack methods, and target profiles—this project seeks to illuminate the underlying factors sustaining the threat of terrorism in Somalia.


### **Key Insights and Findings from the Analysis**

#### **1. Rise in Terrorist Attacks (1975–2020)**
![](images/yearly_trends.png)
- Terrorist incidents in Somalia were minimal in the 1970s and 1980s but escalated dramatically in the 1990s. This surge coincided with Somalia’s civil war, the collapse of central governance, and the rise of extremist factions like Al-Shabaab.

![](images/yearly_attacks.png)

- **Peak in 2014:** The year 2014 saw an unprecedented spike in terrorist activity, with **over 800 attacks** recorded. Despite recent declines, the frequency of attacks remains significantly higher than in earlier decades.
  
**Reason:** The collapse of Somalia’s government in 1991 created a power vacuum, which extremist groups like Al-Shabaab exploited. By 2014, the conflict between these insurgents and the weak Somali government, backed by international forces, reached its height.

**Recommendation:** To reduce these attacks, continued efforts to stabilize Somalia's government and bolster national security forces are essential. Engaging local communities and empowering regional authorities could also play a key role in containing violence.


#### **2. Seasonal Patterns in Terrorism**
![](images/monthly_attacks.png)
- **July sees the highest attacks:** Terrorism peaks in **July**, with more than **600 attacks** recorded. Other months like May and June also experience high levels of activity, while December sees relatively fewer attacks.
  
**Reason:** The spike in July may coincide with key political events or religious observances like Ramadan when extremist groups often intensify attacks for maximum psychological impact. Additionally, insurgents may strategically time attacks when security forces are stretched thin.

**Recommendation:** Intensify security efforts during high-risk months, particularly July. By forecasting patterns of attacks based on past data, Somali forces can proactively thwart planned operations.

#### **3. Weekly Attack Patterns**
![](images/weekly_trend.png)
- **Tuesdays and Sundays are the most dangerous:** The highest number of terrorist attacks happen on **Tuesdays** and **Sundays**, while **Friday**—the day which is the Islamic weekend sees the fewest attacks.

**Reason:** Extremist groups may choose Tuesdays and Sundays for tactical reasons, such as catching security forces off-guard at the beginning of the work week or preparing attacks over the weekend. Fridays tend to have fewer incidents because of Friday prayers.

**Recommendation:** Reinforce security patrols and intelligence operations on high-risk days like Tuesdays and Sundays. Understanding these patterns allows security forces to focus their efforts on days when the threat is most severe.


#### **4. Regional Impact: Banaadir Leads in Attacks**
![](images/region_attacks.png)
- **Banaadir region:** The capital region of **Banaadir**, which includes Mogadishu, experiences the majority of attacks—**over 1,900 incidents**. Other regions, like **Shabeellaha Hoose** and **Awdal**, face fewer attacks, with Awdal seeing only around **20 incidents**.

**Reason:** Mogadishu is not only the political and economic heart of Somalia but also the seat of government and international presence, making it a prime target for insurgent groups like Al-Shabaab. The contrast between urban hubs and rural or peripheral regions reflects insurgent priorities.

**Recommendation:** While Mogadishu needs continued security enhancements, rural areas should not be neglected. Building security infrastructure in smaller towns and regions can prevent militant groups from using these areas as sanctuaries.


#### **5. Urban vs. Coastal Areas**
![](images/citytype_attacks.png)
- **Coastal cities:** Account for **44%** of attacks, with urban centers like Mogadishu and Kismayo being particularly targeted. Border cities face fewer attacks (only **9%**).

**Reason:** Coastal cities like Mogadishu and Kismayo are strategic for extremists because they house key infrastructure like ports, which are vital for trade and insurgent smuggling. Border cities, while important, are often less populated or secure.

**Recommendation:** Coastal city security must remain a high priority. The Somali government should focus on securing key maritime routes and port cities to disrupt insurgent logistics, particularly in smuggling and illegal trade.


#### **6. Explosive Attacks Dominate**
![](images/attack_types.png)
- **Bombings and Explosions** are the most frequent method of attack, with over **2,000 incidents** recorded, followed by **armed assaults**.

**Reason:** Explosives like **IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices)** and **suicide bombings** are devastating in urban areas and allow extremists to inflict mass casualties while causing widespread fear. They’re also relatively inexpensive and easy to deploy in a conflict zone.

**Recommendation:** Investing in bomb detection technologies, training bomb squads, and promoting public vigilance can reduce the impact of these attacks. Additionally, the government should improve forensic capabilities to better trace the origin of explosives.


#### **7. High Civilian Casualties**
![](images/attack_types.png)
- **Bombing/Explosion** attacks cause the highest number of fatalities, resulting in over **13,000 deaths** since the late 1990s. Armed assaults also contribute significantly, with around **6,000 fatalities**.

**Reason:** Bombing tactics, especially in crowded urban areas like markets, government buildings, and hotels, maximize casualties. Al-Shabaab often targets civilians to create terror and erode public confidence in the Somali government.

**Recommendation:** Strengthening emergency response systems and providing public education on how to act during an attack could save lives. Security forces must focus on protecting civilian-heavy areas, particularly during high-risk periods.


#### **8. Surge in Suicide Bombings**
![](images/suicide_trend.png)
- **Suicide bombings** surged after 2011, peaking in 2017 with **over 40 attacks**. Despite a decline, they remain significantly higher than in the past.

**Reason:** Suicide attacks became a preferred method as Al-Shabaab and other extremists sought more destructive ways to attack highly fortified targets like government buildings, military bases, or international organizations.

**Recommendation:** Tracking the networks that facilitate suicide bombers—recruitment, radicalization, and logistical support—will be key in preventing future attacks. Intelligence services must work closely with local communities to detect early signs of radicalization.


#### **9. Use of Unknown Explosive Types**
![](images/weapon_types.png)
- The most commonly used weapons are **unknown explosive types**, followed by **landmines**, indicating a gap in tracking and identifying the exact materials used in attacks.
